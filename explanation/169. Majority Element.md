# Boyer-Moore Algorithm Intuition
The key idea is to use a voting system:

If we pair each occurrence of the majority element with a different element, they will cancel each other out.

Since the majority element appears more than half, it will survive in the end.


# Input:

```python
nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

| Step | num | candidate | count |                      |
| ---- | --- | --------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| 1    | 2   | 2         | 1     |                      |
| 2    | 2   | 2         | 2     |                      |
| 3    | 1   | 2         | 1     |                      |
| 4    | 1   | 2         | 0     | ← cancel out 2 and 1 |
| 5    | 1   | 1         | 1     | ← new candidate      |
| 6    | 2   | 1         | 0     |                      |
| 7    | 2   | 2         | 1     | ← final candidate: 2 |
